# Text-Encryption
This is a simple text encryption and decryption tool developed using Python and tkinter GUI framework. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt text messages using a password-based encryption scheme.

# Features
- Encryption: Encrypts text using base64 encoding.
- Decryption: Decrypts previously encrypted text.
- Password Protection: Requires a password (currently set as "1234") for both encryption and decryption operations.
- Reset Functionality: Clears input fields for re-entry.

# Installation
